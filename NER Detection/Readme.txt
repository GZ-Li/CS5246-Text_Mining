We've tried implementing a BERT-CRF and a BERT for the NER task. However, restricted by the datset size, BERT-CRF doesn't perform well. So, finally, all the 
results in our report (NER step) are from the BERT-NER/BERT-NER_fine_tuning.py.
As requested, we don't put our dataset (both CoNLL2003 and the samples we generated) here. Please contact us if you'd like to learn more.
